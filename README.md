<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a passion for bringing ideas to life in the browser. Growing up in the '90s, I fell in love with the internet, and that passion has driven me to design and develop websites and web applications that are fast\*\*, responsive, and accessible to everyone. I specialize in creating websites for clients with functionalities such as booking systems for apartments, hotels, restaurants, and more.

Additionally, I'm currently diving into the world of DevOps, expanding my skill set to streamline development processes and improve deployment efficiency.

## 📃 I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. It’s like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a>.

Whenever I write documentation, I try to keep the following steps in mind to ensure the reader gets the most out of it:

1. **What** is this documentation about?
2. **Why** is this documentation important?
3. **How** can the reader use this documentation?
4. **When** should the reader use this documentation?
5. **Who** is this documentation for?
